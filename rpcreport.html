		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a">Our implementation handles all legal IDL files to the best of our knowledge.

</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>X Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
Our protocol relies on null termination never naturally occurring for the data that will be sent over the network. Because we were concerned about the network byte ordering, we convert all data to their string form before sending it, along with a null character to signify its end. This is true for the function names (signifying the start of the RPC), and the final messages as well (DONE or BAD).<br><br>
We made this assumption because all valid types (string, int, float, struct (composed of any combination of the first three), array (one of the previous ones), void) that will be sent over the network guarantee no null characters will ever be present in the data.
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
Noah gave guidance through his responses to our Piazza posts.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
It was certainly very rewarding to work on this. Most of our time was spent on writing expression-specific functions to deal with indentations, which was a little bothersome. Though it is true that we were told that indentations were not an important part of the submission, it just helped us feel more clarity with the changes we made to rpcgenerate.
